* Chapter 24: Bash history substitutions

** Section 24.1: Quick Reference

*** Interaction with the history

#+begin_src bash
  # List all previous commands
  history

  # Clear the history, useful if you entered a password by accident
  history -c
#+end_src

*** Event designators

#+begin_src bash
# Expands to line n of bash history
!n

# Expands to last command
!!

# Expands to last command starting with "text"
!text

# Expands to last command containing "text"
!?text

# Expands to command n lines ago
!-n

# Expands to last command with first occurrence of "foo" replaced by "bar"
^foo^bar^

# Expands to the current command
!#
#+end_src

*** [[https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/08/bash-history-expansion/][Word designators]]

    These are separated by ~:~ from the event designator they refer to. The colon
    can be omitted if the word designator doesn't start with a number: ~!^~ is the
    same as ~!:^~.

#+begin_src bash
# Expands to the first argument of the most recent command
!^

# Expands to the last argument of the most recent command (short for !!:$)
!$

# Expands to the third argument of the most recent command
!:3

# Expands to arguments x through y (inclusive) of the last command
# x and y can be numbers or the anchor characters ^ $
!:x-y

# Expands to all words of the last command except the 0th
# Equivalent to :^-$
!*
#+end_src

***  [[https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/08/bash-history-expansion/][Modifiers]]

    These modify the preceding event or word designator.

#+begin_src bash
  # Replacement in the expansion using sed syntax
  # Allows flags before the s and alternate separators
  :s/foo/bar/ #substitutes bar for first occurrence of foo
  :gs|foo|bar| #substitutes bar for all foo

  # Remove leading path from last argument ("tail")
  :t

  # Remove trailing path from last argument ("head")
  :h

  # Remove file extension from last argument
  :r
#+end_src

   If the Bash variable ~HISTCONTROL~ contains either ignorespace or ignoreboth
   (or, alternatively, ~HISTIGNORE~ contains the pattern ~[ ]*~), you can prevent
   your commands from being stored in Bash history by prepending them with a
   space:

#+begin_src bash
# This command won't be saved in the history
foo

# This command will be saved
bar
#+end_src

** Section 24.2: Repeat previous command with sudo

#+begin_src bash
  $ apt-get install r-base
  E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
  E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
  $ sudo !!
  sudo apt-get install r-base
  [sudo] password for <user>:
#+end_src

** Section 24.3: Search in the command history by pattern

   Press ~C-r~ and type a pattern.

   For example, if you recently executed man 5 crontab, you can find it quickly
   by starting to type "crontab". The prompt will change like this:

#+begin_src bash
  (reverse-i-search)`cr': man 5 crontab
#+end_src

   The ~`cr'~ there is the string I typed so far. This is an incremental search,
   so as you continue typing, the search result gets updated to match the most
   recent command that contained the pattern.

   Press the left or right arrow keys to edit the matched command before running
   it, or the enter key to run the command.

   By default the search finds the most recently executed command matching the
   pattern. To go further back in the history press ~C-r~ again. You may
   press it repeatedly until you find the desired command.

** Section 24.4: Switch to newly created directory with !#:N

#+begin_src bash
  $ mkdir backup_download_directory && cd !#:1
  mkdir backup_download_directory && cd backup_download_directory
#+end_src

   This will substitute the Nth argument of the current command. In the example
   ~!#:1~ is replaced with the first argument, i.e. backup_download_directory.

** Section 24.5: Using !$

   You can use the ~!$~ to reduce repetition when using the command line:

#+begin_src bash
  $ echo ping
  ping
  $ echo !$
  ping
#+end_src

   You can also build upon the repetition

#+begin_src bash
  $ echo !$ pong
  ping pong
  $ echo !$, a great game
  pong, a great game
#+end_src

   Notice that in the last example we did not get ping pong, a great game
   because the last argument passed to the previous command was pong, we can
   avoid issue like this by adding quotes. Continuing with the example, our last
   argument was game:

#+begin_src bash
  $ echo "it is !$ time"
  it is game time
  $ echo "hooray, !$!"
  hooray, it is game time!
#+end_src

** Section 24.6: Repeat the previous command with a substitution

#+begin_src bash
  $ mplayer Lecture_video_part1.mkv
  $ ^1^2^
  mplayer Lecture_video_part2.mkv
#+end_src

   This command will replace 1 with 2 in the previously executed command. It
   will only replace the first occurrence of the string and is equivalent to
   ~!!:s/1/2/~.

   If you want to replace all occurrences, you have to use ~!!:gs/1/2/~ or
   ~!!:as/1/2/~.
