* Chapter 3: Navigating directories

** Section 3.1: Absolute vs relative directories

   To change to an absolutely specified directory, use the entire name, starting
   with a slash ~/~, thus:

   ~cd /home/username/project/abc~

   If you want to change to a directory near your current on, you can specify a
   relative location. For example, if you are already in ~/home/username/project~,
   you can enter the subdirectory ~abc~ thus:

   ~cd abc~

   If you want to go to the directory above the current directory, you can use
   the alias ~...~ For example, if you were in ~/home/username/project/abc~ and
   wanted to go to ~/home/username/project~, then you would do the following:

   ~cd ..~

   This may also be called going "up" a directory.
   
** Section 3.2: Change to the last directory

   For the current shell, this takes you to the previous directory that you were
   in, no matter where it was.

   ~cd -~

   Doing it multiple times effectively "toggles" you being in the current
   directory or the previous one.

** Section 3.3: Change to the home directory

   The default directory is the home directory (~$HOME~, typically
   ~/home/username~), so ~cd~ without any directory takes you there 

   ~cd~

   Or you could be more explicit: 

   ~cd $HOME~

   A shortcut for the home directory is =~=, so that could be used as well.

   ~cd ~~
   
** Section 3.4: Change to the Directory of the Script

   In general, there are two types of Bash scripts: 

   1. System tools which operate from the current working directory
   2. Project tools which modify files relative to their own place in the files system

   For the second type of scripts, it is useful to change to the directory where
   the script is stored. This can be done with the following command:

#+begin_src bash
  cd "$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$0")")"
#+end_src

   This command runs 3 commands:
   
   1. =readlink -f "$0"= determines the path to the current script (~$0~)
   2. ~dirname~ converts the path to script to the path to its directory
   3. ~cd~ changes the current work directory to the directory it receives from ~dirname~
   4. the ~cd~ happens only in the shell and will not persist once the shell exits
