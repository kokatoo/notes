* Chapter 27: Scoping

** Section 27.1: Dynamic scoping in action

   Dynamic scoping means that variable lookups occur in the scope where a
   function is called, not where it is defined.

#+begin_src bash
  $ x=3
  $ func1 () { echo "in func1: $x"; }
  $ func2 () { local x=9; func1; } 
  $ func2
  in func1: 9
  $ func1
  in func1: 3
#+end_src

   In a lexically scoped language, ~func1~ would always look in the global scope
   for the value of ~x~, because func1 is defined in the local scope.

   In a dynamically scoped language, ~func1~ looks in the scope where it is
   called. When it is called from within ~func2~, it first looks in the body of
   ~func2~ for a value of ~x~. If it weren't defined there, it would look in the
   global scope, where ~func2~ was called from.
